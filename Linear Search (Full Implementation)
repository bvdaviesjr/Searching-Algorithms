Linear Search – this is the process of looping continously through an array or string from the first – last element until you find the match that you are searching for and return the position at which that content is found or perform an operation with the results.

Implementation (Pseudo-code)
a.	Create a function with two inputs… - an array, and a value you intend to find in the array.
b.	Within the function, create loop that will iterate from the beginning or first index of the array or string until the last index. 
c.	Within the loop, create an if statement that will use the array-content at every iteration and check to see whether its equal to the value you are searching for. If yes, return the index of the array-content that matches the result or perform additional operations on the result.
d.	If there is no result until the end of the loop, return (-1) outside of the loop (but within the function block) to show no-result found.

Example (Concrete)
Given an array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50, 110, 100, 130, 170}
x = 110;
Output : Element x is present at index 6


// Create a helper function to loop though the array and also take two parameters
function searchArr(arr, num){
	// Loop that will iterate through the arr
	for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
		// If statement that will check each element from the loop for the number
		if(arr[i] === num){
			// When the number is found
			return i;
		}
	}
	// When the number is not found
	return -1;
}

// Function that will be used to show the appropriate result from the helper function 
// This function will also take two parameter
function showResult(array, number){
	// This variable will store the appropriate return value from the helper function
	let result = searchArr(array, number);
// This If statement will display the appropriate message based on the result of the return value
	if(result === -1){
		console.log("The number was not found");
	}else{
		console.log("The result was found at " + result);
	}
}

// This will execute the function
showResult([10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50, 110, 100, 130, 170], 110)
